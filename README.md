# Throughput
A TCP/IP and UDP throughtput analyzer with customizable mocks for networks written in .NET

It is finally time to start writing this... the goal is to write a utility that can help troubleshoot local networks. In addition to randomly generating packets and content I would like this program to have ways to mock port scans as well as diagnose selected errors, such as HTML error conditions, etc.

The program will features a circular buffer to replay error triggers. Can be integrated to router analyzers to investigate failure points.
